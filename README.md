###How this works

Create a directory called "local" in the same _root_ as the "assets" directory and upload files.

###Getting Started

Included is the _oneframework_ SASS framework that handles core elements like forms, buttons, typography, etc. 
You can change the _variables_ partial for the branding and template colors.

Just clone the repo and then _cd_ into the project directory and run _npm install_ and it will start
installing the grunt dependcies for the project. Then just run _grunt server_ and you're all set.
